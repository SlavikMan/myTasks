# myTasks
 My pet project is a simple and intuitive to-do list application that
 I developed using SCSS, HTML, and native JavaScript. The goal of the
 project was to create a tool that would help me organize my daily
tasks more efficiently. <br /><br />
 One of the features that I am most proud of is the clean and
 user-friendly interface of the application. The application is
designed with a minimalistic and modern approach that allows for an
easy and intuitive user experience. The application is optimized for
both desktop and mobile devices, allowing for seamless integration
into my daily routine. <br /><br />
 To store the to-do list data, I used a JSON server that allows for
easy data management and manipulation. The JSON server also allows
for data persistence, ensuring that my to-do list remains available
even if I close or refresh the application. <br /><br />
 Overall, I am incredibly satisfied with the outcome of the project.
It has allowed me to better organize my daily tasks and has been an
excellent tool for increasing productivity and time management.
